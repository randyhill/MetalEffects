Simple video effects recording at 60 FPS using pure Metal

This is a simple video camera app that uses the Metal library to apply three different effects (Saturation, Brightness and Contrast), while writing video stream to disk at 30 FPS.

The app UI is pretty basic, use the Saturation/Birghtness/Contrast sliders to adjust their values in real-time, frame rate is displayed in the FPS floater and should maintain 60 FPS until you turn on recording, which should maintain 30 FPS while writing.
